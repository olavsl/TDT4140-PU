# Peregrinate - explore the world
This web application is a application for backpacking. 
The goal of the application is to share your own experiences, see and like others travels, and be inspired to try new destinations!

## To start, run the following commands:
```
cd client
npm start
cd server
npm start
```

### The project structure
We have divided our project into two parts: a Client and a Server.  The backend side consists of mongoose models, resolvers and files for starting the Apollo server. Our application is connected to a MongoDB database that on the virtual machine. The frontend or client consists of the application itself, with different views containing presentational components.  

## MongoDB 
MongoDB may be a suitable database for use in a web application for a number of reasons. MongoDB was chosen because of its ease of deployment, administration, and scalability. A benefit of MongoDB is that it is a NoSQL database, which allows it to be more flexible than other traditional SQL databases. If your data is not well defined or if you need to change the database structure quickly, this can be very useful. MongoDB can also handle large amounts of data since it is easy to scale. As a final point, MongoDB is known for its reliability and speed.

### Mongoose
Mongoose was chosen for interacting with the database since it facilitates the creation of models for the data. The data can be accessed in a specific manner using this tool. Furthermore, Mongoose provides useful methods for querying and updating data, and it was well documented. Some of the group members already had good experiences with mongoose and MongoDB that made it easier to choose.

## ReactJS
As our frontend framework, we choose to use traditional ReactJS. TypeScript is per 2022 more used than 
JavaScript, but due to the timelimit we choose to keep it easier with JavaScript.
React is a great web application framework and is traditionaly used a lot both in classes like this and in different work situations.
Some of our members had good experience with React, in addition to other frameworks. However, as React is often a demand in work applications and this was the framwrok more of us knew, is was natural to choose React.
